## Overview

AD - Pigeon Clocking System is a practical backend for pigeon clubs. It provides a modular CodeIgniter 4 codebase, Dockerized development environment, and example modules that show how to add domain-specific features like race management and club administration.

Built for local and club use, the system assumes a MySQL-compatible database and ships with migrations and seeders to get test data in place quickly. Developers can extend controllers, services, and repositories to add new features or integrate a frontend.

Purpose: help club managers and developers bootstrap a reliable pigeon race management app.

Audience: pigeon club organizers, small teams, and developers who want a predictable CI4 structure with Docker and MySQL.

### Key Components
These are the core modules included in this repo (or intended to be implemented as part of the system):

| Component             | Purpose                                                           | Notes / implementation details                          |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Auth                  | User authentication and role-based access for managers and staff.  | Uses CI4 sessions; can be extended for JWT or OAuth.   |
| CRUD                  | Generic create/read/update/delete patterns used across entities.   | Demonstrates Controller → Service → Repository pattern. |
| Scheduler             | Race scheduling and task reminders for race days and deadlines.    | Useful for organizing race timelines and notifications. |
| Account Management    | Manage club user accounts, permissions, and contact details.       | Admin-facing UI and APIs expected.                     |
| Club Management       | Manage clubs, members, lofts, and bird registrations.              | Central domain model for club operations.              |
| Race Management       | Create races, record clockings/results, and generate reports.      | Core domain module — supports encoding and results.    |

<!-- Use these modules as practical, domain-focused starting points — replace or extend them as needed. -->

## Quick Start (Docker)

Run the development stack and the app (rebuild if needed):

```cmd
docker compose up --watch
```

Common utility commands (run inside the project root):

- Run migrations:
```cmd
docker compose exec php composer migrate
```
- Run seeders:
```cmd
docker compose exec php composer seed
```
- Run tests:
```cmd
docker compose exec php composer test
```

- Create a migration (using CodeIgniter's spark tool):
```cmd
docker compose exec php php spark make:migration CreateUsersTabel
```

- Create a model (using CodeIgniter's spark tool):

```cmd
docker compose exec php php spark make:model UsemModel
```

- Create an entity (value object for a single record) (using CodeIgniter's spark tool):
```cmd
docker compose exec php php spark make:entity Uzer
```

- Create a controller (add --resource to scaffold resourceful methods if you like) (using CodeIgniter's spark tool):
```cmd
docker compose exec php php spark make:controller Users
```

- Create a seeder (for test/dev data) (using CodeIgniter's spark tool):
```cmd
docker compose exec php php spark make:seeder UserzSeeder
```

If you prefer, you can include `-f "compose.yaml"` explicitly; the shorter commands above work when running from the repo root.

## Ports & Database

Defaults used in this project (host mapping):

| Service     | Host port |
|-------------|-----------:|
| nginx (app) | 8090      |
| phpMyAdmin  | 8091      |
| MySQL       | 3390      |

Database credentials used in examples and CI:

- Host: localhost
- Port: 3390
- Database: app
- User: root
- Password: root

Be careful: seeding and truncating are destructive operations — run only on local/dev environments unless you know what you're doing.

## Rules, Practices and Principles

<!-- ! Dont Revise this -->

1. Always prefix project titles with `AD-`.
2. Place files in their **respective CI4 folders** (`Controllers/`, `Services/`, `Repositories/`, `Views/`).
3. Naming conventions:

   | Type             | Case        | Example                   |
   | ---------------- | ----------- | ------------------------- |
   | Classes          | PascalCase  | `UserService.php`         |
   | Interfaces       | PascalCase  | `UserRepositoryInterface` |
   | DB tables/fields | snake\_case | `users`, `created_at`     |
   | Docs             | kebab-case  | `dev-manual.md`           |

4. Git commits use: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `refactor`.
5. Use **Controller → Service → Repository** pattern.
6. Assets (CSS/JS/img) live under `public/`.
7. Docker configs are at the repo root (`docker-compose.yml`, `nginx.conf`).
8. Docs are maintained in `/docs` (dev, technical, sop, commit, principles, copilot).

Example structure:

```
AD-ProjectName/
├─ backend/ci4/
│  ├─ app/Controllers/
│  ├─ app/Services/
│  ├─ app/Repositories/
│  ├─ app/Views/
│  ├─ public/
│  ├─ writable/
│  ├─ .env
│  └─ composer.json
├─ docker/               # Docker configs at root
├─ docs/                 # Manuals and project docs
├─ .gitignore
└─ readme.md
```
